# pi_by_coprime
A stand-alone C program that approximates the value of π by using the mathmatical proof that states that the probability that two random numbers are co-prime is 6/π².  

This program generates pairs of random numbers for a given number of iterations, and then gets the percentage of those numbers that were co-prime and then uses this number to aproximate π.

Inspired by a video from Matt Parker (standupmaths) for Pi Day, 2017.
